# Competitive programming snippets

These snippets are for use in online programming contests (e.g. on Codeforces,
Topcoder, GCJ and other platforms that allow pre-written code).

The snippets provided here serve as model implementations of some frequently
used algorithms and techniques in solutions authored [by me]
(http://codeforces.com/profile/x3n). The main sources of snippets are CLRS's
*Introduction to Algorithms* and refactored (more readable?) versions
of code snippets from [e-maxx.ru](http://e-maxx.ru/algo/).

***Disclaimer***: Although these snippets are mainly for internal use (i.e.
to be used by myself with the repository serving as public proof of prior
existence of the code), it's not forbidden for anyone to use them on such
sites as long as they explicitly allow code that is not authored by the
contestant himself.

## Todo's

* Provide the repository with more snippets (obviously)
* Preface the snippets with meaningful commentaries on the specifics
